# Unity Port - Work In Progress ⚠️

This folder contains the Unity C# implementation of Five Nights at Mr Ingles's.

## Status: 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT

The Unity port is currently being developed and is **not ready for use yet**.

### What's Here:
- `Unity_Scripts/` - All C# gameplay scripts
- `Editor/` - Unity Editor tools and scene generation scripts

### Current State:
- ✅ Core gameplay logic ported
- ✅ Manager systems implemented
- ✅ UI controllers created
- ⏳ Scene setup and integration in progress
- ⏳ Asset integration pending
- ⏳ Testing and optimization needed

## For Now: Use the Python Version

The **Python/Pygame version** (`main.py`) is the **fully functional, optimized version**.

Run it with:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Unity Port ETA

The Unity port will be ready when:
- Scene auto-setup is complete
- All assets are properly imported
- Performance testing is done
- UI layout matches Python version

---

**Current Recommendation:** Stick with `main.py` - it's optimized and runs at 60 FPS.
